`evm-cfg-builder` is used to extract a control flow graph (CFG) from EVM bytecode. It is used by Ethersplay, Manticore, and  other tools from Trail of Bits. It is a reliable foundation to build program analysis tools for EVM.

We encourage contributions that address any known [issues](https://github.com/trailofbits/evm_cfg_builder/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and will pay out bounties for accepted PRs. Join us on the [Empire Hacking Slack](https://slack.empirehacking.nyc) to discuss using or extending `evm-cfg-builder`.

## Features

* Reliably recovers a Control Flow Graph (CFG) from EVM bytecode using a dedicated Value Set Analysis
* Recovers functions names
* Recovers attributes (e.g., payable, view, pure)
* Outputs the CFG to a dot file
* Library API

## Usage

### Command-line

To export basic dissassembly information, run:
```bash
evm-cfg-builder mycontract.evm 
```

To export the CFG of each function (dot format), run:
```bash
evm-cfg-builder mycontract.evm --export-dot my_dir 
```

dot files can be read using xdot.

### Library
See [examples/explore_cfg.py](examples/explore_cfg.py) and [examples/explore_functions.py](examples/explore_functions.py) for library examples.
